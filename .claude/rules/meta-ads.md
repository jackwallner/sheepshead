# Sheepshead Trainer: Meta SDK, ATT and remote switches (inert)

Ported from Mahj, by way of the sibling card trainers. Mahj's
`.claude/rules/meta-ads.md` and `project-docs/marketing/meta-ads.md` hold the
full story.

- `MetaAds` is inert while `META_APP_ID` and `META_CLIENT_TOKEN` are empty in
  `project.yml` (they are empty): no SDK start, no ATT prompt, nothing sent. It
  never starts on a simulator either. The Facebook SDK (exact 18.1.1,
  `FacebookCore`) is linked and its Info.plist keys are present, so turning it
  on is two strings. Change the App Store privacy labels and add a Meta section
  to the privacy page in the SAME submission that sets the ids, never before.
- `MetaAds.start` runs in `AppDelegate`, `linkRevenueCat()` right after
  `Purchases.configure`, `activateApp()` on every foreground.
- ATT is asked only after a trial start or a purchase (Jack 2026-10-19), so
  only paying players are prompted and the relay can count a consented trial
  within its 15 minutes. `SubscriptionService.purchase` calls
  `MetaAds.notePurchase()` on every completed purchase (onboarding page,
  paywall, any one-tap sale; restore is not a purchase), which stores
  `meta.askAfterPurchase`; `HomeView.askForTrackingIfNeeded` asks on the next
  bare Home and `requestTracking` clears the flag. A player who never starts a
  trial or buys never sees the prompt. Guards kept: onboarded, bare Home, 1.2s
  settle, not in a launch that showed What's New (`WhatsNew.shownThisLaunch`),
  after the offering loaded (`remoteConfigKnown`), and `att_prompt` not `off`.
  Never move it to launch or onboarding. `askApple()` stays `nonisolated`
  (Swift 6 trap).
- StartTrial belongs to a server relay, never to RevenueCat's Meta integration.
  The relay lives in the Mahj repo (`supabase/functions/meta-trial-relay`) and
  is NOT ported. When Sheepshead gets a Meta app id the relay needs a per-app
  row/config (its Meta dataset id, token and RevenueCat webhook entry) before
  the ids go into `project.yml`, or trials are never reported.
- `RemoteConfig` reads the current RevenueCat offering's metadata: `trial_cta`
  (`seven_day` control: "Start 7-day free trial" on onboarding and "Start 7-Day
  Free Trial" on the paywall; `my`: "Start my free trial"; `your`: "Start your
  free trial") and the switches `att_prompt`, `rating_prompt`, `challenge` (on
  unless exactly `off`; set the same on every offering). The `challenge` switch
  is declared but nothing reads it: Sheepshead has no monthly challenge, and
  Sheepshead Minute (a members-only daily set) is not behind it. A future
  challenge must gate its Home card and deep link on it (`AppDestination.isFree`
  is ready for a free challenge route). DEBUG builds pin any key with
  `-sheepshead.rc.<key> <value>`; `-sheepshead.previewMetaATT` shows the real ATT
  alert in captures.
